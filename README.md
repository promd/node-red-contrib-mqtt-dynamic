WORK IN PROGRESS !

This is a set of nodes for NodeRed that support dynamic creation and management of MQTT connections (rather than connections you need to setup in static config nodes).

While functional, these nodes require documentation, as their usage is not straight forward.    
Stay tuned for updates if the tagline sounds promising.
